TASK 1:Prediction using Supervised ML: A regression type of problem where we had a data with study hours/day, scores of few students. The end goal was to predict the percentage of marks a student gets based on the number of study hours.

Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we had to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

TASK 3: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm: For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we had to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose was if we feed any new data to this classifier, it should be able to predict the right class accordingly.
